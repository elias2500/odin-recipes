    <h2>Description</h2>    
    <p>
        Loukoumades are fried Greek honey puffs. They're popular all around the
        Mediterranean, especially in Greece, and are beloved as a Hanukkah
        treat among Sephardic Jews.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water, no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C)</li>
        <li>½ cup warm milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>⅓ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup honey</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>4 cups vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Sprinkle yeast over 1 cup warm water in a small bowl. Let stand until 
            yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix together warm milk, sugar, and salt in 
            a large bowl until sugar and salt are dissolved. 
            Pour in yeast mixture and stir to combine. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat in flour, eggs, and butter until mixture forms a smooth, 
            soft dough. Cover the bowl and let rise at room 
            temperature until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. 
            Stir dough well, cover, and let rise again for 30 more minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, mix together honey and 1/2 cup 
            water in a small saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. 
            Turn off the heat and allow honey syrup to cool. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 2 inches oil in a deep fryer or 
            large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Place a large serving or soup spoon in a 
            glass of water near dough. Scoop up about 2 tablespoons 
            dough per puff with the wet spoon, drop 
            it into the wet palm of your hand, and roll it back into the spoon to 
            create a round shape. Do not overhandle the puffy, soft dough. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Drop dough balls into hot oil in batches, wetting the spoon each 
            time you make a dough ball. Fry in hot oil until golden brown on 
            the bottom, then roll them over to cook the other side, 2 to 3 minutes 
            per batch. Gently set loukoumades aside to drain on a paper towel-lined 
            plate. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Place loukoumades on a baking sheet. Drizzle with honey syrup 
            and sprinkle with cinnamon. Serve warm. 
        </li>
    </ol>
